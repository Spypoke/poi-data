# POI Data Updates

This repository hosts the update data for the POI system used by the app.

It contains:
- `manifest.json` – version information and download URLs
- `pois.sqlite.gz` – compressed SQLite database with the latest POIs

The app checks the manifest regularly and downloads the database if a newer version is available.
